						<p>Easy Tab Manager eases the management of tabs/windows, especially for those who like to keep a lot of tabs and windows opened.</p>
						<b>Please do the following after the install:</b>
						<p>Go to the Extensions page (for example, with Ctrl+Shift+e or choose "Manage" in the Extensionbar's context menu) and check on "Enable in Private Mode". This is important for the proper working of Easy Tab Manager.</p>
						<br />
						<b>How to use:</b>
						<p>You can call actions with buttons from the sidebar or with context Menu.</p>
						<p>After opening the popup with the toolbar button, the first thing to do (except at buttons with the word 'all' or at certain menu actions) is to select your chosen tabs or windows for a certain action.</p>
						<p>The selection in the Window/Tab list is easy: just leftclick on an item to select it and do it again to unselect. You have to select tabs you can search for tabs in any of your Opera windows. You can also make actions with tabs from different windows at the same time.</p>
						<br />
						<b>Notes:</b>
						<p>You can select only windows or only tabs at the same time.</p>
						<p>You don't need to select anything from the tablist if you'd like to change one certain item by the use of the context menus. On the other hand, please make sure that you've unselected all items before you intend to use Context Menus just on the clicked tab or window.</p>
						<p>Finally, click on the command button you need or call context menu and click on your chosen action there.</p>
						<p>Easy Tab Manager saves the browsing history into a list so you can reopen any recently loaded site into a separate tab by doubleclicking from the history list's context menu.</p>
						<p>You can easily switch between the tablist and the history list by clicking on the upper buttons "Current" and "History".</p>
